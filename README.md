# BoAt — Board of Things

A production-grade, deterministic automotive simulation and testing platform for Software-in-the-Loop, Hardware-in-the-Loop, and CI/CD validation pipelines.

---

## What is BoAt?

BoAt is a tick-based simulation gateway that bridges virtual and physical CAN/Ethernet networks. It provides a deterministic simulation engine, a plugin SDK for custom node logic, a gRPC API surface, and a Python CLI/SDK — all designed for OEM engineers and Tier-1 suppliers who need repeatable, hardware-integrated testing.

## Key capabilities

- **Deterministic core** — Tick-based scheduler with seeded determinism guarantees bit-identical replay across runs and environments.
- **CAN & Ethernet HIL** — Supports both virtual (`vcan*`) and physical CAN interfaces (PEAK PCAN, Kvaser, gs_usb) via SocketCAN, plus virtual Ethernet over UDP multicast.
- **Plugin SDK** — C ABI v6 plugin interface with `on_tick`, `on_can_frame`, `on_eth_frame` hooks. Load `.so` plugins at runtime. Built-in plugins: vehicle dynamics, sensor simulation, CAN transport protocol (ISO 15765-2), SOME/IP middleware.
- **gRPC API** — 15 protobuf services: Simulation, Signal, Scenario, Replay, Fault, Metrics, Trace, CAN, Ethernet, PDU, Plugin, Debug, and the always-on BusService.
- **Python SDK + CLI** — `boat-py` package with `BoAtClient`, `CanNode`, `PduNode` classes. `boat-cli` with commands for sim, scenario, CAN, PDU, CAN-TP, replay, trace, and plugin management.
- **PDU routing** — AUTOSAR-inspired PDU router with I-PDU groups, cyclic/onChange/mixed transmission schedules, and COM signal packing (Intel/Motorola, E2E CRC).
- **Event store & replay** — SQLite-backed event store. Deterministic replay controller reconstructs any prior simulation run.
- **Fault injection** — Seeded deterministic fault injector for reproducing fault scenarios (signal errors, CAN dropouts, timing faults).
- **Web dashboards** — 10 standalone FastAPI services providing live CAN frame traces, signal monitoring, PDU editing, trace analysis, and system dashboards.

## Quick start

```bash
# Prerequisites (Ubuntu)
sudo apt install cmake ninja-build g++ libacl1-dev
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Build
cd boat-platform
cmake --preset debug && cmake --build --preset debug

# Setup virtual CAN
sudo modprobe vcan
sudo ip link add vcan0 type vcan && sudo ip link set vcan0 up

# Launch
BOAT_CAN_INTERFACES=vcan0 ./build/debug/src/gateway/grpc_gateway/boat_gateway

# In another terminal
pip install -e boat-platform/sdk/python[dev] && pip install -e boat-platform/cli
boat can list-buses
```
